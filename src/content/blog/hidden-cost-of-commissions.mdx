Every company that pays commissions eventually hits the same wall.

The spreadsheets never match. The formulas break. The payout disputes pile up. What should motivate sales teams ends up slowing everyone down.

Behind every missed target and messy reconciliation there's the same root cause. **The systems that are supposed to automate commissions are too complicated to actually use.**

## The Setup Trap

Companies spend months setting up tools that were meant to save them time. They buy into promises of automation, but then get stuck in never-ending integrations and configuration cycles. What starts as a simple problem turns into a full-blown operational nightmare.

Finance teams spend hours verifying calculations. RevOps teams build temporary workarounds. Sales reps stop trusting the numbers. Leadership meetings turn into postmortems instead of strategy sessions. 

And when you add it up, the cost is huge. Time. Focus. Morale.

## The Real Problem

The truth is, commissions are not a spreadsheet problem. **They are a setup problem.**

Legacy tools like Spiff, CaptivateIQ, and Xactly built complex systems that work for enterprises with full-time admins and consultants. But mid-market and growing SaaS companies can't afford that kind of overhead. They need something that just works right away.

> The moment you have to hire someone to manage your "automation tool," it stops being automation.

## The Hidden Implementation Reality

What no one talks about is how painful the setup process really is. Connecting CRMs, mapping pay rules, syncing payroll data, debugging when the numbers don't match â€” it takes months before you can even start seeing accurate payouts. By that point, your team has already lost confidence in the system.

**Commissions should be instant.** When someone closes a deal, they should know what they earned right away. Finance should be able to see total liability in real time. RevOps should have visibility without waiting for manual exports.

## A Different Approach

The current tools treat setup as a cost of doing business. We don't buy that.

At Ryft, we believe that setup should disappear completely.

You plug in your CRM, your HR platform, and your payroll system. Ryft understands your structure, parses your compensation plans, and builds your payout models automatically. No implementation cycle. No manual mapping. No waiting for results.

**Because the real future of commissions isn't just automation. It's zero setup time.**
