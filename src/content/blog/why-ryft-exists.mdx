If tools like Microsoft Copilot and Claude already exist, a reasonable question is:

**Why build Ryft at all?**

The answer has nothing to do with model quality.
It has everything to do with what kind of problems these tools are designed to solve.

## Horizontal AI vs vertical systems

Copilot and Claude are horizontal by design.
They are built to work across domains and help with:

- writing formulas
- summarizing documents
- explaining logic
- answering ad-hoc questions

They are extremely useful.

But they are assistants.
They respond to prompts.
They do not own workflows.

**Commission management is not a promptable problem.**

## Commissions are a system, not a task

A commission workflow spans weeks or months and crosses teams.
It includes:

- interpreting plan language
- tracking changes over time
- handling exceptions and overrides
- reconciling CRM, payroll, and finance data
- explaining outcomes before deals close
- surviving disputes and audits

You cannot solve this with a single good prompt.

You need memory, rules, versioning, and explainability.
You need consistency over time.
You need accountability.

**This is where horizontal AI stops.**

## Why "Copilot in Excel" breaks down quickly

Yes, Copilot can help write formulas.
But commission failures almost never come from formulas.

They come from:

- silent plan changes
- ambiguous language
- one-off exceptions becoming precedent
- inconsistent handling of similar deals
- explanations happening after payout

Copilot does not know what changed last quarter.
Claude does not know which exception set precedent.
Neither can enforce consistency across time.

Humans end up doing that work manually.
That is the real bottleneck.

## Ryft is opinionated by necessity

Ryft is not trying to be a better assistant.
It is built to be a system that holds up under scrutiny.

That means:

- domain-specific logic for commissions
- stateful understanding of plans and exceptions
- deterministic behavior where trust matters
- built-in explainability, not post-hoc explanations
- an audit trail that survives questions

**This is not an AI problem.
It is a systems problem.**

## Speed vs reliability

Horizontal AI makes work faster inside a tool.
Vertical systems make outcomes reliable across tools.

In commission workflows, reliability matters more than cleverness.
Trust matters more than novelty.
Quiet systems beat flashy ones.

**That is why Ryft exists.**
